"This WordPress plugin is part of my agap&eacute; try, a lifelong effort to "
"love God and love people by rightly using the time and abilities He has "
"leant me. As a husband, father, engineer, farmer and/or software developer, "
"I have found this stewardship effort to be often fraught with contradiction. "
"A wise and sustainable balancing of roles has seemed to elude me. Yet I want "
"to keep trying, trusting that if God blesses and multiplies the effort, it "
"will become agapetry, a creative arrangement motivated by benevolent love.  "
"A fleeting childlike sketch of the beautiful %1$s chain-breaking agap&eacute;"
